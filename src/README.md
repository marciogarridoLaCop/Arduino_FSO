### Firsts steps to configure your application ###

1 - Choose the library for your project.

unophoto10.h - For 10 bits resolution ( Arduino uno port from A0 to An) limited from arduino type, in this case, six ports.
shield_adsphoto.h - For 16 bits resolution (Ads 1115 port from A0 to An) limited from Ads port type, in this case, four ports.

2 - Adjust in main.cpp how many ports do you want to read -  
#read_serial_string(2);
